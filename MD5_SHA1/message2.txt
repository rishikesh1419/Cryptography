Security Threats
Computer systems face a number of security threats. One of the basic threats is data loss, which means that parts of a database can no longer be retrieved. This could be the result of physical damage to the storage medium (like fire or water damage), human error or hardware failures.Another security threat is unauthorized access. Many computer systems contain sensitive information, and it could be very harmful if it were to fall in the wrong hands. Imagine someone getting a hold of your social security number, date of birth, address and bank information. Getting unauthorized access to computer systems is known as hacking. Computer hackers have developed sophisticated methods to obtain data from databases, which they may use for personal gain or to harm others.A third category of security threats consists of viruses and other harmful programs. A computer virus is a computer program that can cause damage to a computer's software, hardware or data. It is referred to as a virus because it has the capability to replicate itself and hide inside other computer files.
